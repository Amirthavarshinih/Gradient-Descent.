# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

## Overview
This project estimates the best-fit slope (`m1`) for a dataset using two methods:
1. **Brute-Force Search** – Tries different slope values and picks the best one based on Mean Squared Error (MSE).
2. **Gradient Descent** – Optimizes `m1` iteratively to minimize MSE efficiently.

## Features
- Generates synthetic data with noise.
- Compares brute-force and gradient descent methods.
- Visualizes dataset, loss curves, and results.
- Uses an object-oriented approach for clean, modular code.

## Installation
Install dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib


It will display:
- A scatter plot of the dataset.
- Loss curves for both methods.
- A comparison of efficiency.

## Efficiency
Gradient Descent is much faster than brute-force search, requiring fewer iterations to reach an optimal solution.
